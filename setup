# Changes made in the last modification :
# 1. Adding commented docs and more comments to the script's code in order to make it more clean and easily readable to the programmers and other hackers.
# 2. Removing some errors and also adding the git installed or not checker before cloning the actual project.
# 3. Removing some packages list that were to be installed, as in the last modification of the instahack.sh script, we have removed the requirement for installing those tools. The tools are - lolcat.
